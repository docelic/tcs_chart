<h1>Tox Client Standard (TCS) - Compliance Matrix</h1>

<p><a href="https://tox.gitbooks.io/tox-client-standard/content/index.html">https://tox.gitbooks.io/tox-client-standard/content/index.html</a></p>

<p>Tox Client Standard (TCS) is intended to define behaviours that are not enforced by toxcore, but are otherwise required or recommended to ensure proper client interoperability as well as best security practices.

For a Tox client to be endorsed and supported by the Tox Project, it must, at minimum, comply with every required point in the TCS.

The following table shows current known state of software compliance to the TCS.</p>

<p><strong>Legend:</strong><br>
<span class="pad must compliant">Yes</span> &mdash; TCS requires or recommends point, and software implements it.<br>
<span class="pad should non-compliant">No</span> &mdash; TCS recommends point, but software does not implement it.<br>
<span class="pad must non-compliant">No</span> &mdash; TCS requires point, but software does not implement it.<br>
<span class="pad n-a unknown">N/A</span> &mdash; TCS does not apply, and software's implementation of point does not apply or is unknown.<br>
<span class="pad n-a compliant">Yes</span> &mdash; TCS does not apply, however it is known that software implements point.<br>
<span class="pad n-a non-compliant">No</span> &mdash; TCS does not apply, however it is known that software does not implement point.<br>
<span class="pad n-a unknown">?</span> &mdash; Status of implementation is unknown, and pull requests containing updated information are welcome.<br>
